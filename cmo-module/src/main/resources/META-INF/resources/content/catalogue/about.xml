        <p>
          The online database CMO Source Catalogue is based on the sources used for the critical edition
          of the music pieces and song texts to find concordances, which serve as a reference and basis
          to compare different versions of a work. It provides access to the metadata of numerous printed,
          manuscript and online sources, works included in these sources, as well as basic biographical
          information on their composers and lyricists. Additionally, it contains metadata of bibliographical
          sources used as references for the edition and the catalogue itself. The metadata of CMO editions
          incorporated into the catalogue enables the user to access critical editions through the original
          sources they are based on.

          the different functions are provided in the <u>user guide</u>.
